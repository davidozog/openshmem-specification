\apidescription{
  A team configuration argument acts as an input
  \FUNC{shmem\_team\_split\_*} routines.
  It specifies the requested capabilities of the team to be
  created.

  The \VAR{num\_contexts} member specifies the total number of simultaneously
  existing contexts that the program requests to create from this team.
  These contexts may be created in any number of threads. Successful
  creation of a team configured with \VAR{num\_contexts} of $N$ means
  that the implementation will make a best effort to reserve enough
  resources to allow the team to have $N$ contexts created from the team
  in existance at any given time. It is not a guaruntee that $N$
  calls to \FUNC{shmem\_team\_create\_ctx} will succeed.
  See Section~\ref{sec:ctx} for more on communication contexts and
  Section~\ref{subsec:shmem_team_create_ctx} for team-based context creation.

  When using the configuration structure to create teams, a mask parameter
  controls which fields to use.
  Any configuration parameter value that is not indicated in the mask will be
  ignored, and the default value will be used instead.
  Therefore, a program does not have to set all fields in the config struct;
  only those for which it does not want the default values.

  A configuration mask value is created by combining individual field
  masks with through a bitwise OR operation of the following library constants:

  {
    \apitablerow{\LibConstRef{SHMEM\_TEAM\_NUM\_CONTEXTS}}{
      The team should be created using the value of the
      \VAR{num\_contexts} member of the configuration parameter
      \VAR{config} as a requirement.
    }
  }

  A configuration mask value of \CONST{0} indicates that the team
  should be created with the default values for all configuration
  parameters.

  The default values for configuration parameters are:

  {
    \apitablerow{num\_contexts = \CONST{0}}{
      By default, no contexts can be created on a new team
    }
  }

}
