When using the \openshmem \ac{API}, synchronization, ordering, and completion of
communication become critical. The updates via \PUT{} routines, \acp{AMO}, stores, and
nonblocking \PUT{} and \GET{} routines on symmetric data cannot be guaranteed until some form of
synchronization or ordering is introduced in the user's program. The table below
gives the different synchronization and ordering choices, and the situations
where they may be useful.\\
